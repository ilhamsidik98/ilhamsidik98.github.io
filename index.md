## About Me

Hi! I am a master student in the [Department of Computer Science and Electronics (DCSE)](https://dcse.fmipa.ugm.ac.id/) at Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. Also, I am a software developer at the [Geoseismal Research Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/geoseismal/posts/?feedView=all).

My research for my thesis focuses on Machine Learning and Data Imbalance based on Geophysics data, mainly handling imbalance dataset to solve high-cost data acquisition. I am passionate about developing AI in Geoscience to develop more adavanced technology in data processing and data acquisition.
